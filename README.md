# mybci-lab

The goal of the project is to provide an open-source BCI software, with current development focused on EEG data.

### This project is **work-in-progress**. Though the following is functional:
- recording EEG sessions with ```session.py``` script, including pipeline settings for marking actions and playing custom functions eg. sounds to signal the actions to the user.
- processing of raw EEG data with ```mybci``` library, including the creation and manipulation of datasets for ML model training.
- GUI for the BCI system. Planned to support all of the above as well as reinforcement learning and more. See ```example_system/``` for the current state. (The system is generated through ```mybci``` library)

### Documentation:
